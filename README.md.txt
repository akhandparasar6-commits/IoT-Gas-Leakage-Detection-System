# IoT Gas Leakage Detection and Alert System 🚨

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects LPG or harmful gas leakage using an MQ2 gas sensor and sends alerts through WiFi using ESP8266. The system activates a buzzer when gas concentration exceeds a threshold value.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a real-time gas leakage detection system for safety applications using IoT technology.

## 🔧 Components Used
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard
- WiFi Connection

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. MQ2 sensor detects gas concentration.
2. NodeMCU reads analog value.
3. If gas level exceeds threshold:
   - Buzzer turns ON
   - Alert message is displayed
4. Data can be transmitted to cloud platform for monitoring.

## 🌐 Technologies Used
- Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
- ESP8266 WiFi
- IoT Communication

## 📈 Applications
- Home Kitchen Safety
- Gas Storage Monitoring
- Industrial Safety Systems
